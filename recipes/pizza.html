        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Red peppers</li>
        <li>Artichoke</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
        <li>Jalapenos</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pizza dough and let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour before stretching.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F (or as high as your oven goes). Sprinkle a little cornmeal in the center of a large baking sheet. Place the dough on the baking sheet and stretch it into a large oval.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the all types of cheeses.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce evenly onto the dough. Top with the cheese mixture, the onions, red peppers, artichokes, and jalapeño, if using. Drizzle with olive oil and bake for 10 to 13 minutes, or until the crust is browned around the edges and the cheese and toppings are lightly browned. The timing will depend on the heat of your oven.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, sprinkle with red pepper flakes, if desired, and top with fresh basil leaves. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
